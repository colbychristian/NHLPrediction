A simple program to estimate winner of Stanley Cup Finals

model uses past historical NHL statistics by team from 1976 to 2020 to predict 2021 winner.

parameters used in historical training data are only included if they can be logically called on at any point of the current season (e.g. power play percentage)

output is a teh predicted winner by row of the input data and percentages that can be matched up to each team.

this code is for my own learning purposes.

to do: learn how to extract winner and list of teams (strings) from data.
